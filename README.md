# Research Overview
My research focuses on AI-assisted Cybersecurity solutions for autonomous vehicles. I conduct ethical hacking experiments on real-world UAV systems to analyze vulnerabilities. I execute Denial of Service (DoS), Replay, Evil Twin, Stealthy False data injection attacks, etc. I build systems that learn patterns from and collect data about the network, operator, and attacker behaviors. Using machine learning, I analyze the data my system collects to uncover critical operational threats and risks. My goal is to design an intelligent intrusion detection system that can automatically detect and respond to sophisticated attacks. 

% I use machine learning for analysis, of the data my systems collect to uncover threats and risks, surface critical operational challenges and threats and develop intrusion detection systems to tackle attacks.
