# Research Overview

My research focuses on AI-assisted Cybersecurity solutions for autonomous vehicles. I conduct ethical hacking experiments on real-world UAV systems to analyze vulnerabilities. I execute Denial of Service (DoS), Replay, Evil Twin, Stealthy False data injection attacks, etc. I build systems that learn patterns from and collect data about the network, operator, and attacker behaviors. Using machine learning, I analyze the data my system collects to uncover critical operational threats and risks. My goal is to design an intelligent intrusion detection system that can automatically detect and respond to sophisticated attacks.
